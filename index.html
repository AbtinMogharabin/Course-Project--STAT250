                        In this project, I implemented some of the interesting topics I learned in COGS543 (Computational Semantics) and COGS532 (Computational Morphology and Syntax) graduate courses.
                        • During the project, a semantic parser was implemented in Python.
                        • For the syntactic rules, Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG) alongside internal merge grammar was used, and for logic and semantics, Untyped Lambda Calculus and Modality Logic were implemented.
