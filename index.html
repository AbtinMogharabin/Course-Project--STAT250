                    • The term project of the graduate course: Probabilistic Models of Cognition.
                    • In this project, I will be working on the development of a novel approach to Medical Shared Decision Making using Appraisal Theory and Rational Speech Acts models.
                    • The implementation will be done in WebPPL probabilistic programming language.

                <h3>CCG Semantic Parser</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I implemented some of the interesting topics I learned in COGS543 (Computational Semantics) and COGS532 (Computational Morphology and Syntax) graduate courses.
                    • During the project, a semantic parser was implemented in Python.
                    • For the syntactic rules, Combinatory Categorical Grammar (CCG) alongside internal merge grammar was used, and for logic and semantics, Untyped Lambda Calculus and Modality Logic were implemented.

                    • Implemented a Scheme interpreter in Julia.
                    • For a large part, I followed the content of SICP Textbook and Peter Noverg's Tutorials.

                <h3>Bayesian Analysis on BART</h3>
                <p>
                    • Using Bayesian methods, multiple models were used to analyze the BART dataset (Balloon Analog Risk Task).
                    • Bayesian Linear models, Bayesian Non-linear models, Bayesian Multi-level Models, and Bayesian Gaussian processes were implemented in the modeling process.
                    • The implementation was done using PyMC.

                <p>
                    • This was a four-month survey and analysis project. We conducted a survey on international students at 17 Turkish universities about their motivations, expectations, and satisfaction using the poststratification sampling method.
                    • Analyzed the survey results by the use of Statistical inference and machine learning modules, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, K-NN, Kernel SVM, and Gradient Boosting.
